# Azure AI Integration Demo – Intelligent Defect Tracking for Manufacturing

## 🧠 Scenario Overview

This demo simulates a real-world engagement with a manufacturing customer who has developed an internal defect tracking application. The customer wants to enhance their solution by integrating Azure AI capabilities to:

- 📷 Analyze uploaded images of defective parts using **Azure Cognitive Services (Vision API)**
- 📝 Summarize technician notes using **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)**
- ⚠️ Detect anomalies in defect patterns using a **custom ML model deployed via Azure ML**

As a Digital Solution Engineer, the goal is to guide the customer through secure, scalable integration of Azure AI into their existing application—accelerating productivity and unlocking new insights.
