please help me with the Azure AI demo. I would like to setup a github repo in which to document the demo. Normally I would clone that repo locally to vs code and deploy via terraform, but for this project I want to use ARM templates to showcase using those. In my day to day currently most branches of Toyota that I help are manufacturing teams or engineers and we help solve their problems with solutions in the cloud. For this demo, however, I'd like to simulate helping a customer who has an application they've developed which they're looking integrate Azure AI into.
Perfect framing, John. Let‚Äôs simulate a customer scenario where you‚Äôre helping a product team integrate Azure AI into their existing app. This will showcase your solution architecture, AI integration, and customer enablement‚Äîexactly what Microsoft wants to see.

üöÄ Demo Concept: Azure AI Integration for a Customer App
üß† Scenario
A manufacturing customer has built a web app for internal defect tracking. They want to integrate Azure AI to:

Automatically extract insights from uploaded images (e.g., damaged parts)

Summarize technician notes using Azure OpenAI

Flag anomalies using a basic ML model

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
Component	Service	Purpose
Frontend App	Static Web App / App Service	Customer‚Äôs existing UI
Image Analysis	Azure Cognitive Services (Vision API)	Detect defects from images
Text Summarization	Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)	Summarize technician notes
Anomaly Detection	Azure ML / Custom Model	Flag unusual patterns
Storage	Blob Storage / Cosmos DB	Store images and metadata
Security	Key Vault, Managed Identity	Secrets and access control
Deployment	ARM Templates	Showcase infrastructure-as-code
